# Basic Frequency Modulation


## Set up

Start by getting JUCE in this folder:

    git clone https://github.com/juce-framework/JUCE

Also, say `brew install clang-format` on the terminal to get a great code formatting tool.

Use the Visual Studio Code editor unless you know what you are doing. Open this folder in VScode so that this README is in the root of the workspace.

Install these extensions:

- Microsoft's C/C++ (IntelliSense)
- Microsoft's CMake Tools
- Xaver Hellauer's Clang-Format

Once you have these extensions, close and reopen VScode.
